description: "Creates interactive, animated web presentations viewable in any browser — not PowerPoint files. Use this skill when the user wants a web-based or browser-viewable presentation, an interactive slide deck, or something more engaging than a static slide file. Perfect for pitches, proposals, data stories, reports, and technical talks. Trigger when the user says 'interactive presentation', 'web slides', 'web presentation', 'HTML presentation', or when they want slides that can be shared as a URL, need animations/motion/interactivity, or want to 'wow' their audience with something live on the web. Also trigger for scroll-based storytelling or immersive one-pagers when the context is presenting information. If the user asks for a 'presentation' or 'deck' without specifying .pptx, prefer this skill over the pptx skill unless they explicitly want a PowerPoint file."

# Interactive Presentation Skill

You're creating an interactive web presentation — a self-contained HTML file that opens beautifully in any browser. Not a PowerPoint. Something alive: animated, polished, web-native.

Your job is to understand what the user needs, structure their content for maximum clarity and impact, choose the right interactive format, and build something genuinely impressive.

## Phase 1: Discovery

**This phase is mandatory. Do not skip it, do not abbreviate it, do not jump to style or build.**

The discovery phase has a strict order:
1. Ask audience, goal, and delivery questions
2. Generate the style preview and get a pick
3. Produce a ghost list for confirmation (Phase 2)
4. Only then build

Before writing a line of code, understand the full picture. Ask these questions — but don't just list them dryly. **Make proposals and offer clear options** based on what you already know. If the user said "investor pitch for a fintech startup," you already know quite a bit — lead with an educated guess and let them confirm or adjust.

### Questions to cover (adapt based on what you already know)

**Audience & Goal**
- Who will see this? (executives, developers, customers, investors, students...)
- What's the core message — the one thing they should remember?
- What do you want them to feel or do after?

**Delivery**
- Will you present it live (you control the flow) or share it for async viewing (they navigate themselves)?
- Will it be shown on a big screen, shared as a URL, or embedded in a website?

**Content**
- What content do you have? Ask them to paste an outline, upload a document, describe the topic, or share a URL.
- If they give you raw content, tell them what you're going to do with it before doing it.

**Aesthetic**
- Don't ask the user to describe their aesthetic in words — most people can't. Show them options instead.
- Pick 3 presets from `STYLE_PRESETS.md` that fit the topic and audience.
- Generate a `style-preview.html` file using the Style Preview Template from `STYLE_PRESETS.md`, showing all 3 presets as mini swatches side by side.
- Tell the user: *"Open `style-preview.html` in your browser — which one feels right? Or describe something different."*
- Wait for their pick before building. This one step prevents the most common iteration loop.

**Interactivity** (recommend based on delivery mode)
- Live presentation → recommend slide mode with animated reveals
- Async share → recommend scroll-based storytelling OR slide mode with self-navigation
- Training or audience participation → recommend fully interactive (quizzes, branching)
- Portfolio/showcase → recommend scroll-based cinematic experience

Be direct with your recommendation. "Based on what you told me, I'd go with scroll-based storytelling — here's why..." and let them push back.

## Phase 2: Content Processing

### Always produce a ghost list first (unless the user already gave you one)

When the source is a document, URL, or free-form description, **do not go straight to building**. First convert the source into a proposed slide-by-slide ghost list and confirm it with the user. This prevents the most expensive iteration: building the wrong structure.

**Ghost list format:**
```
Slide 1 — [Title]
  Headline: [One-sentence slide headline]
  Content: [What goes on this slide — key point, stat, visual idea]

Slide 2 — [Title]
  Headline: ...
  Content: ...
```

After presenting the ghost list, ask:
> "Does this capture what you need? Anything to add, cut, or reorder before I build?"

Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding to Phase 3 and 4.

---

### Handling each input type

**Ghost list / outline (user already gave you one)**: Skip the ghost list step — you have it. Expand thin bullets into full slide content with context, transitions, and narrative flow. Still confirm the structure if it's complex.

**Document (PDF, Word, Markdown, URL)**: Read and extract. Identify the key ideas, reduce to essentials, create a logical arc. Build a ghost list showing what you're keeping, what you're cutting, and why. Present it for confirmation before building.

**Free-form description**: Ask clarifying questions if the topic is vague, then draft the ghost list yourself — slide titles, key messages, supporting points. Confirm before building.

### Communication best practices (apply to all content)

- **Pyramid Principle**: Lead with the conclusion. One clear headline per slide that stands alone. Details follow, not precede.
- **One idea per slide**: If you need two sentences to summarize a slide's point, split it.
- **Show, don't tell**: Replace bullet lists with visuals wherever possible — stats as large callouts, comparisons as side-by-side layouts, processes as step diagrams.
- **Narrative arc**: Hook → Problem/Tension → Solution → Evidence → Call to Action. Every presentation tells a story.
- **Audience calibration**: Executives want conclusions fast. Technical audiences want depth and data. Investors want traction and vision. Students want clarity. Match the vocabulary, depth, and pacing to who's watching.
- **Rule of clarity**: Every slide should answer "so what?" If it doesn't, cut it or reframe it.

## Phase 3: Choose the Presentation Mode

Recommend and confirm one of these three modes before building:

### Mode A: Slide Deck
Classic slides, keyboard/click navigation (← → arrow keys, space bar). Best for live presentations.
- Each slide fills the screen
- Content enters with animated reveals (staggered text, charts that draw in, images that fade)
- Smooth slide-to-slide transitions
- Optional: presenter notes, progress bar, slide counter

### Mode B: Scroll Story
User scrolls down to advance through the narrative. Best for async sharing, reports, one-pagers.
- Each section locks into view as you scroll (scroll-jacking or smooth scroll)
- Content animates in as it enters the viewport
- Feels like an interactive article or annual report
- No navigation UI — scrolling IS the interaction

### Mode C: Interactive Deck
Slide-based but with embedded interactions. Best for training, demos, proposals with choices.
- Quizzes with scoring
- Expandable detail panels ("click to learn more")
- Branching paths ("choose your scenario")
- Embedded calculators or configurators
- Data filters / toggles

## Phase 4: Build

### Technical approach

Build a **single self-contained HTML file** that works in any modern browser without a server.

**Libraries (load via CDN — fast and reliable):**
- **GSAP** + **ScrollTrigger**: all animations. Don't use CSS animations for anything complex.
- **Chart.js**: data visualization when needed (charts, graphs)
- **Google Fonts**: always load from the chosen preset in `STYLE_PRESETS.md` — never default to Inter, Roboto, or Arial.

```html
<!-- CDN imports -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.5/gsap.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.5/ScrollTrigger.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```

**CSS variables:** Copy the full `:root {}` block from the chosen preset in `STYLE_PRESETS.md` and use these variables throughout. Never hardcode colors or fonts inline — use `var(--accent)`, `var(--font-display)`, etc. This makes style iteration instant.

**File structure (all inline in one .html):**
```
<head>  — Google Fonts, all CSS
<body>  — slide/section markup
<script> — GSAP animations, navigation logic
```

### Design principles (borrow from frontend-design skill)

- **Pick a bold visual direction and commit.** Don't hedge. Minimal and precise or maximal and expressive — both work. Half-measures don't.
- **Typography matters more than anything.** Pair a distinctive display font with a clean body font. The headline font should have personality. Make the type hierarchy obvious and deliberate.
- **Color with purpose.** One dominant color (60-70% visual weight), one supporting tone, one sharp accent. Never equal weights. Match the palette to the content's emotional register.
- **Every slide needs a visual anchor** — a large stat, an icon cluster, an image, a chart. Pure text slides are forgettable.
- **Animate with restraint.** A few well-timed animations beat a dozen random ones. The first slide entrance should feel polished. Transitions should feel smooth, not showy.
- **Negative space is a design tool.** Don't fill every pixel.
- **Comment your code.** The HTML file will be opened and edited by non-engineers. Add section comments (`<!-- SLIDE 3: Problem -->`) and brief JS comments explaining the navigation logic. Comments are kindness to future-you.

### Slide layout patterns

| Pattern | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| **Full-bleed hero** | Title slide, section breaks |
| **Split (content left, visual right)** | Text + image, stat + explanation |
| **Large stat callout** | Key numbers, percentages, metrics |
| **Icon grid (2×2 or 3×3)** | Features, principles, categories |
| **Timeline / process flow** | Steps, phases, history |
| **Comparison columns** | Before/after, options, pros/cons |
| **Quote / testimonial** | Social proof, key statement |
| **Chart + insight** | Data slide with the "so what?" |

### Navigation (for slide modes)

Always include all four input methods — users navigate however feels natural to them.

```javascript
// 1. Keyboard
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'ArrowRight' || e.key === ' ') nextSlide();
  if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') prevSlide();
});

// 2. Click zones (left half = back, right half = forward)
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  // Ignore clicks on interactive elements
  if (e.target.closest('button, a, input, [data-no-nav]')) return;
  if (e.clientX > window.innerWidth / 2) nextSlide();
  else prevSlide();
});

// 3. Touch / swipe
let touchStartX = 0;
document.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => { touchStartX = e.touches[0].clientX; }, { passive: true });
document.addEventListener('touchend', (e) => {
  const delta = touchStartX - e.changedTouches[0].clientX;
  if (Math.abs(delta) > 50) delta > 0 ? nextSlide() : prevSlide();
}, { passive: true });

// 4. Mouse wheel
let wheelCooldown = false;
document.addEventListener('wheel', (e) => {
  if (wheelCooldown) return;
  wheelCooldown = true;
  setTimeout(() => wheelCooldown = false, 800);
  e.deltaY > 0 ? nextSlide() : prevSlide();
}, { passive: true });
```

**Navigation dots** — include a visual dot indicator:
```html
<!-- In your HTML, after the slides -->
<nav class="slide-dots" aria-label="Slide navigation">
  <!-- Generated by JS: one dot per slide -->
</nav>
```
```css
.slide-dots {
  position: fixed; bottom: 24px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);
  display: flex; gap: 8px; z-index: 100;
}
.dot {
  width: 8px; height: 8px; border-radius: 50%;
  background: var(--text-secondary); opacity: 0.4;
  cursor: pointer; transition: all 0.3s;
  border: none; padding: 0;
}
.dot.active { background: var(--accent); opacity: 1; transform: scale(1.3); }
```
```javascript
// Build dots dynamically
function buildDots() {
  const nav = document.querySelector('.slide-dots');
  slides.forEach((_, i) => {
    const dot = document.createElement('button');
    dot.className = 'dot' + (i === 0 ? ' active' : '');
    dot.setAttribute('aria-label', `Go to slide ${i + 1}`);
    dot.addEventListener('click', (e) => { e.stopPropagation(); goToSlide(i); });
    nav.appendChild(dot);
  });
}
// Update on slide change
function updateDots(index) {
  document.querySelectorAll('.dot').forEach((d, i) => d.classList.toggle('active', i === index));
}
```

### Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation always included
- `aria-label` on navigation elements
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; transition-duration: 0.01ms !important; }
}
```

## Phase 5: Preview & Iterate

After building, open the file in the browser and describe what you made — the visual direction, the flow, the number of slides, and what interactive elements are included.

Tell the user:
- What file to open (its path)
- What to click/press to navigate
- What the key design choices were and why

Then ask: "What would you like to adjust?" Be ready to iterate on:
- Content (add/remove/rewrite slides)
- Style (colors, fonts, layout)
- Animations (more/less/different)
- Interactivity (add a quiz, add chart, add branching)

---

## Quick reference: Avoid these mistakes

- **Don't skip Phase 1 discovery.** Always ask about audience, goal, and delivery before anything else. These answers change the mode, structure, emphasis, and closing — skipping them wastes everyone's time.
- **Don't jump from source doc straight to building.** When the input is a document or URL, produce a ghost list first, confirm it, then build.
- **Don't ask the user to describe their aesthetic in words.** Generate the style preview file and let them react to visuals.
- **Don't echo bullet points onto slides.** Transform the content, don't transcribe it.
- **Don't use Inter, Roboto, or Arial as display fonts.** Always use the fonts from the chosen preset in `STYLE_PRESETS.md`.
- **Don't hardcode colors.** Use CSS variables from the preset throughout — it makes switching styles trivial.
- **Don't animate everything.** 3-5 well-timed animations per presentation beat 30 distracting ones.
- **Don't use purple gradients on white backgrounds.** This is the hallmark of generic AI output.
- **Don't forget the "so what?" on data slides.** A chart without an insight caption is incomplete.
- **Don't skip navigation.** Always include keyboard, click, touch, swipe, and wheel support. Navigation dots too.
- **Don't ship uncommented code.** Add slide section comments and brief JS explanations — the user will edit this file.
